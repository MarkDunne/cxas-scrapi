# Local Simulations

Local Simulations take a different approach to testing than Platform Goldens. Instead of scripting exact conversations and expected responses, you describe a *goal* and let an AI-powered user simulator (Gemini) try to achieve it. At the end, Gemini judges whether the agent met the goal and any additional expectations you specified.

This is valuable when you want to test that an agent can *complete a task*, without caring about the exact phrasing of each response — which is especially important for voice agents where natural language variation is expected.

---

## How simulations work

1. SCRAPI starts a real session with your agent using the Sessions API
2. Gemini plays the role of a human user, sending messages to the agent to try to achieve the goal
3. The conversation continues until the goal is met, the max number of turns is reached, or the agent ends the session
4. Gemini evaluates whether each step's `success_criteria` was met and whether any `expectations` were satisfied
5. SCRAPI produces a report with pass/fail status for each step and expectation

Because the user is simulated by a language model, the conversation is non-deterministic — each run may produce slightly different messages. This mirrors how real users behave.

---

## YAML format

Simulation files use the `evals:` key at the top level:

```yaml
evals:
  - name: "successful_order_lookup"
    tags: ["P0", "order_management"]
    session_parameters:
      order_12345_status: "shipped"
      order_12345_eta: "2026-04-18"
    steps:
      - goal: "Ask about the status of order ORD-12345"
        success_criteria: "The user has provided order ID ORD-12345 and the agent has acknowledged it"
        response_guide: "The user is a customer checking on a recent purchase. They are polite but want a quick answer."
        max_turns: 3

      - goal: "Get the order status and delivery date"
        success_criteria: "The agent has provided the shipping status and the estimated delivery date"
        max_turns: 2

    expectations:
      - "The agent correctly identified the order as shipped"
      - "The agent mentioned the estimated delivery date"
      - "The agent maintained a friendly, helpful tone throughout"
```

### Top-level fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `name` | string | Unique name for this evaluation |
| `tags` | list | Tags for filtering (e.g., `["P0", "smoke"]`) |
| `session_parameters` | dict | Variables injected at session start |
| `steps` | list | Ordered sequence of conversational goals |
| `expectations` | list | Post-conversation quality assertions evaluated by Gemini |

### Step fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `goal` | string | What the simulated user is trying to accomplish in this step |
| `success_criteria` | string | The condition that determines whether this step is complete |
| `response_guide` | string | Persona and context hints for the simulated user |
| `max_turns` | int | Maximum turns allowed before declaring the step incomplete |
| `static_utterance` | string | Instead of AI simulation, send this exact text (useful for testing specific inputs) |
| `inject_variables` | dict | Variables to inject for the first step only (overrides session_parameters) |

### Expectations

Expectations are evaluated by Gemini *after the full conversation completes*, looking at the entire transcript. They're natural language assertions:

```yaml
expectations:
  - "The agent never made up information that wasn't in the tool response"
  - "The agent asked for the order ID before looking it up"
  - "The agent offered to help with anything else before ending"
```

Each expectation is judged as Met or Not Met, with a justification from Gemini.

## The `SimulationEvals` class

For programmatic use, import `SimulationEvals`:

```python
from cxas_scrapi.evals.simulation_evals import SimulationEvals

sim_evals = SimulationEvals(
    app_name="projects/my-project/locations/us/apps/my-app",
)
```

### Running a single evaluation programmatically

The `simulate_conversation` method takes a `test_case` dict defining the steps and expectations:

```python
from cxas_scrapi.evals.simulation_evals import SimulationEvals

sim_evals = SimulationEvals(app_name="projects/my-project/locations/us/apps/my-app")

test_case = {
    "steps": [
        {
            "goal": "Ask about order ORD-12345",
            "success_criteria": "User provided order ID and agent acknowledged",
            "max_turns": 3,
        },
        {
            "goal": "Get delivery date",
            "success_criteria": "Agent provided estimated delivery date",
            "max_turns": 2,
        },
    ],
    "expectations": [
        "Agent maintained professional tone",
        "Agent never hallucinated data",
    ],
}

eval_conv = sim_evals.simulate_conversation(test_case=test_case)
report = eval_conv.generate_report()

# Goals report (one row per step)
print(report.goals_df)

# Expectations report (one row per expectation)
if report.expectations_df is not None:
    print(report.expectations_df)
```

### Running in parallel

Simulations can be slow because they involve multiple real API calls. Run them in parallel to speed things up:

```python
import concurrent.futures

test_cases = [...]  # list of test_case dicts

def run_single(tc):
    eval_conv = sim_evals.simulate_conversation(test_case=tc, console_logging=False)
    return eval_conv.generate_report()

with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=5) as executor:
    futures = [executor.submit(run_single, tc) for tc in test_cases]
    reports = [f.result() for f in concurrent.futures.as_completed(futures)]
```

!!! tip "Parallel execution and rate limits"
    The Sessions API and Gemini both have rate limits. Start with `max_workers=3` and increase if you're not hitting errors. The skills system's Run skill handles this automatically.

---

## Audio modality

If your agent handles voice conversations, you can run simulations in audio mode:

```python
sim_evals = SimulationEvals(app_name="projects/my-project/locations/us/apps/my-app")

eval_conv = sim_evals.simulate_conversation(
    test_case=test_case,
    modality="audio",  # default is "text"
    # voice_config is optional (defaults to US English voice)
    voice_config={
        "language_code": "en-US",
        "voice_name": "en-US-Standard-A"
    }
)
```

In audio mode, SCRAPI uses the Sessions API's audio streaming endpoint. The simulated user's messages are still text internally, but they're processed by the agent's audio pipeline, which exercises TTS/STT and any audio-specific callbacks.

---

## Naturalness Metric

Goals and expectations judge *what* the agent did. The **Naturalness Metric** judges *how it said it*: Gemini grades every agent turn on how closely it resembles a warm, competent human contact-centre agent rather than a script-reading bot.

Use it for voice and GECX / Gemini Composite agents, where emotive expression, pacing, disfluency, emotive tags (`[warm]`, `[short pause]`, `[sigh]`), and spoken-form numbers matter as much as task completion. A turn can complete every goal and still sound robotic — this metric is what catches that.

> [!NOTE]
> The metric is entirely **opt-in**. A test case that does not declare a `naturalness_metric` key behaves exactly as it did before: no extra Gemini call is made, and no extra keys appear in the results. Existing simulation YAML needs no changes, and a YAML file written against a newer version still loads (unknown keys inside the block are tolerated, not rejected).

### Minimal example

The shorthand `true` enables the metric with all defaults:

```yaml
evals:
  - name: upset_caller_billing_dispute
    tags: [P0, voice, naturalness]
    naturalness_metric: true
    steps:
      - goal: Complain about an incorrect charge and get it refunded
        success_criteria: Agent apologizes, looks up the account, and issues a refund
        max_turns: 10
```

Use `naturalness_metric: false` to explicitly disable it. The keys `naturalness` and `naturalness_config` are accepted as aliases for `naturalness_metric`.

### Fully-configured example

```yaml
evals:
  - name: upset_caller_billing_dispute
    tags: [P0, voice, naturalness]
    naturalness_metric:
      enabled: true
      model: "gemini-2.5-pro"
      turn_qualities: [emotion, pacing, grammarStyle, disfluency, spokenNumbers]
      conversation_qualities: [personaConsistency, emotionalArcTracking]
      extra_guidance: >
        This is a US English voice agent. Currency must be spoken as
        "a hundred and fifty dollars", never "USD 150". Keep the calm
        register for the whole call once the caller has been upset.
      turn_weight: 0.8
      bot_like_below: 2.5
      human_like_at_or_above: 4.0
      pass_threshold: 3.5
      use_audio: false
      include_tool_calls: true
    steps:
      - goal: Complain about an incorrect charge and get it refunded
        success_criteria: Agent apologizes, looks up the account, and issues a refund
        max_turns: 10
```

### Configuration fields

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | bool | `true` | Set to `false` to keep the block in the file but skip grading |
| `model` | string | *(unset)* | Grading model. Falls back to the simulation's `eval_model` when unset |
| `turn_qualities` | list | `[]` | Overrides the graded turn-level dimensions. Empty means "use the defaults" |
| `conversation_qualities` | list | `[]` | Overrides the graded conversation-level dimensions. Empty means "use the defaults" |
| `extra_guidance` | string | `""` | Free-text rubric addendum appended to the prompt (brand voice, locale specifics) |
| `turn_weight` | float | `0.75` | Blend between the per-turn mean and the conversation-level mean. Clamped to 0.0–1.0 |
| `bot_like_below` | float | `2.5` | Scores below this are labelled `Bot-like` |
| `human_like_at_or_above` | float | `3.75` | Scores at or above this are labelled `Human-like` |
| `pass_threshold` | float | *(unset)* | When set, the simulation only passes if `overall_score` reaches this value |
| `use_audio` | bool | `false` | Attach the captured agent WAVs so speech is judged acoustically. Requires running the simulation with `capture_agent_audio=True` |
| `include_tool_calls` | bool | `true` | Show tool calls in the graded transcript, so "thinking out loud while looking something up" is judged in context |

!!! tip "Malformed blocks never fail a run"
    A `naturalness_metric` block that isn't a mapping or bool, or that fails validation, is logged as a warning and treated as "off". The same is true of grading failures (quota errors, unparseable JSON, a trace with no agent turns): they log and return no result rather than failing the simulation.

### Default turn-level qualities

Every agent turn is scored 1–5 on each of these:

| Quality | Measures |
|---------|----------|
| `emotion` | Reads the user's emotional state and responds with the appropriate complementary register, with matched emotive tags |
| `pacing` | Conversational rhythm: pauses, `[slow]`, ellipses, digit chunking — and no tag over-saturation |
| `grammarStyle` | Natural imperfection: contractions, fragments, varied sentence length rather than textbook prose |
| `disfluency` | Filler and bridge phrases, hesitation, self-correction, brief thinking-out-loud while working |
| `lexicalVariety` | Avoids recycling the same openers, acknowledgements, and phrasing seen in earlier turns |
| `concision` | Says one thing and waits, instead of paragraph-shaped info dumps or restating the request |
| `spokenNumbers` | Numbers, dates, times, currency, and identifiers rendered the way a person says them aloud |
| `empathyCalibration` | Empathy when warranted, capped at roughly one explicit statement per call, no premature celebration |
| `scriptedness` | Freedom from IVR boilerplate, reflexive closings, and corporate/legalese register |
| `turnTaking` | Natural acknowledgement and handoff questions, no re-asking for information already supplied |

### Default conversation-level qualities

These are scored once across the whole call:

| Quality | Measures |
|---------|----------|
| `personaConsistency` | The agent is the same person throughout, with no tonal whiplash or register drift |
| `repetitionAvoidance` | Across the call, phrases, empathy lines, and sentence shapes are not recycled |
| `emotionalArcTracking` | Tracks the user's emotional trajectory, holds the gentle register, and only brightens when the user does |
| `conversationalFlow` | The call feels like one continuous conversation, not a series of context-free replies |

### How labels and scores are computed

Each factor score is an integer clamped to 1–5. Turn and overall scores are then derived by SCRAPI (not taken from the model's own holistic number), which keeps the scores, averages, and labels mutually consistent:

1. **Turn score** = mean of that turn's factor scores, rounded to two decimals. (If the model returned no factors for a turn, its own score is used instead.)
2. **Turn label** comes from the score bands:
   - `score < bot_like_below` → `Bot-like` (default: below 2.5)
   - `score >= human_like_at_or_above` → `Human-like` (default: 3.75 and up)
   - otherwise → `Transitional`
3. **Overall score**:

   ```text
   overall_score = turn_weight * mean(turn scores)
                 + (1 - turn_weight) * mean(conversation factor scores)
   ```

   If the grader returned no conversation-level factors, `overall_score` is simply the mean of the turn scores. The result is clamped to 1–5 and rounded to two decimals, where **5 means fully human-like**.

4. **Overall label** is derived from `overall_score` using the same bands.

### Pass/fail behaviour

By default the metric is **purely informational** — it reports a score and a label but never changes whether the simulation passed.

Setting `pass_threshold` opts the test case into enforcement: the simulation fails if `overall_score` is below the threshold, even when every goal and expectation was met.

```yaml
naturalness_metric:
  pass_threshold: 3.5  # fail the sim if the agent scores below 3.5/5
```

### Enabling it for a whole run

You can turn the metric on without editing any YAML, using the `naturalness` argument on the constructor, `run_simulations()`, or `simulate_conversation()`:

```python
# Enable with defaults for every test case that doesn't declare its own block
sim_evals = SimulationEvals(app_name=app_name, naturalness=True)

# Same, at call time
results = sim_evals.run_simulations(test_cases=test_cases, naturalness=True)

# A dict is merged OVER whatever the test case declared
eval_conv = sim_evals.simulate_conversation(
    test_case=test_case,
    naturalness={"pass_threshold": 4.0, "model": "gemini-2.5-pro"},
)
```

- `None` (the default) defers entirely to each test case.
- `True` enables the metric with defaults for test cases that don't declare the key. A test case with an explicit `naturalness_metric: false` stays off.
- `False` force-disables the metric everywhere, even where a test case asked for it.
- A dict is merged over the test case's own block, so run-level keys win.

The CLI exposes the same switch on `evals report`:

```bash
# Grade every simulation, even ones that don't declare the metric
cxas evals report --run --include sims --naturalness

# Skip grading entirely, even for test cases that do declare it
cxas evals report --run --include sims --no-naturalness

# Omit the flag to let each test case decide
cxas evals report --run --include sims
```

The flag is tri-state, mirroring the `naturalness` argument: `--naturalness` is `True`, `--no-naturalness` is `False`, and omitting it is `None`.

> [!TIP]
> `--no-naturalness` is the hill-climbing switch. Iterate on correctness first with grading off — it skips the extra Gemini call per run and stops any `pass_threshold` from failing a simulation that is functionally correct — then drop the flag to evaluate naturalness once the task success rate is where you want it.


### What you get in the results

When the metric ran, each entry in `sim_results.json` gains three keys (they are **absent** when it did not run, so existing consumers see an unchanged payload):

| Key | Example | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `naturalness` | `"4.1/5"` | The overall score |
| `naturalness_label` | `"Human-like"` | `Bot-like`, `Transitional`, or `Human-like` |
| `naturalness_details` | *(object)* | The full result: per-turn gradings and factors, `conversation_factors`, `factor_averages`, `label_counts`, `summary`, `model`, `pass_threshold`, and `passed` |

The console progress line also gains a ` | naturalness: 4.1/5 (Human-like)` suffix.

Programmatically, the result object lives on the conversation and feeds the report:

```python
eval_conv = sim_evals.simulate_conversation(test_case=test_case, naturalness=True)

result = eval_conv.naturalness_result  # None if the metric didn't run
if result:
    print(result.overall_score, result.overall_label.value)
    print(result.factor_averages)  # mean score per quality across turns
    print(result.summary)

report = eval_conv.generate_report()
if report.naturalness_df is not None:
    print(report.naturalness_headline)  # e.g. "Overall: 4.1/5 (Human-like)"
    print(report.naturalness_df)
```

### Cost

Grading adds **one extra Gemini call per simulation run** (per test case, per repeat), sending the whole transcript. It's cheap relative to the simulation itself, but it is not free — reserve it for the evals where sounding human actually matters, and note that `use_audio: true` adds the captured WAVs to that call.

---

## Interpreting results

The `SimulationReport` object has two DataFrames, plus an optional third when the [Naturalness Metric](#naturalness-metric) ran:

### `goals_df`

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `eval_name` | Name of the simulation |
| `step_index` | Which step (0-indexed) |
| `goal` | The goal text |
| `status` | `Completed` or `Not Completed` |
| `justification` | Gemini's explanation |
| `turns_used` | How many turns it took |

### `expectations_df`

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `eval_name` | Name of the simulation |
| `expectation` | The expectation text |
| `status` | `Met` or `Not Met` |
| `justification` | Gemini's explanation |

### `naturalness_df`

Present only when the Naturalness Metric ran — otherwise `report.naturalness_df` is `None`. One row per graded agent turn:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `turn` | Agent turn index (0-indexed) |
| `label` | `Bot-like`, `Transitional`, or `Human-like` (colorized in the terminal) |
| *(one per quality)* | The 1–5 score for each graded quality, e.g. `emotion`, `pacing`, `grammarStyle` |
| `justification` | Gemini's explanation for the turn |

`report.naturalness_headline` carries the summary line, e.g. `Overall: 4.1/5 (Human-like)`, with ` | threshold 3.5 -> PASS` appended when `pass_threshold` is set.

### Reading the output

```python
# Overall pass rate
total = len(report.goals_df)
passed = (report.goals_df["status"] == "Completed").sum()
print(f"Steps completed: {passed}/{total} ({passed/total*100:.0f}%)")

# Failed steps
failed = report.goals_df[report.goals_df["status"] != "Completed"]
for _, row in failed.iterrows():
    print(f"FAILED: {row['goal']}")
    print(f"  Reason: {row['justification']}")
```

## Using Tool Fakes

By default, simulations execute real tool calls (including webhooks or database queries) when the agent invokes a tool. During testing, you can enable **Tool Fakes** to tell the platform to return pre-defined mock/fake responses instead of running the actual tool backend.

> [!NOTE]
> Tool fakes (mock tool responses) are defined per-tool within the Agent Studio Console. See the [Mock Tool Responses](mock-tool-responses.md) guide for how to configure these in the console and write the mock handler scripts.

To enable tool fakes in your simulations:

### Programmatically
Pass `use_tool_fakes=True` when calling `simulate_conversation` or `run_simulations`:

```python
eval_conv = sim_evals.simulate_conversation(
    test_case=test_case,
    use_tool_fakes=True,  # Bypasses real tool backends
)
```

### Via CLI
Run your simulations in bulk using the `cxas evals report` command with the `--run` and `--include sims` flags, specifying the agent app name, output directory, parallel workers, and the `--use-tool-fakes` flag:

```bash
cxas evals report \
    --run \
    --include sims \
    --app-name "projects/my-project/locations/us/apps/my-app" \
    --output-dir "eval-reports" \
    --sim-parallel 5 \
    --use-tool-fakes
```

## Tips for writing good simulations

**Keep steps focused**
: Each step should test one thing. Broad goals like "complete the full conversation" are hard to debug when they fail.

**Write meaningful success criteria**
: "The agent helped the user" is too vague. "The agent provided the order status and delivery date" is testable.

**Use `response_guide` to set tone**
: If your agent needs to handle impatient users or edge cases, use `response_guide` to set that context for the simulator.

**Use `static_utterance` for exact inputs**
: When you want to test how the agent handles a specific phrasing (e.g., "what's my ETA?"), use `static_utterance` to send that exact text.

**Use session parameters for mocking**
: Just like goldens, use `session_parameters` to inject mock tool responses so your simulations are deterministic and fast.
